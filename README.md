# Repository for Replication of "Do Not Resist: How Police Militarization..."
Replication data for the paper "Do Not Resist: How Police Militarization Increased Repressionâ€™s Likelihood Across 98 Countries."

### How to Run Replications
A lot of the code is designed to be plug and play in R or R Studio, making use of the file.choose() command instead of setting a working directory and accessing the files directly.
- IST 470 Project Analysis Script.R uses IST 470 and SURF Data for Analysis.csv
